This is an application I wrote for a local Parish.
Often in the tourist seasons, visitors from everywhere come to the Church and write checks as donations or offerings.
The Pastor came to me with a request for an app that could keep track of visitors.
So I wrote this app using AngularJS, PHP and HTML.
It includes login functionality, Users can change their own passwords, Admins can change any user info, and a one to many relationship for users and their donations.

sfx.sql is the DB schema
